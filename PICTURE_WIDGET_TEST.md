# Picture Widget Implementation Test Guide

## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

The picture widget feature has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### üóÇÔ∏è Files Created/Modified

1. **`extension/storage-manager.js`** - IndexedDB manager for large image storage
2. **`extension/widgets/picture-widget.js`** - Picture widget implementation  
3. **`extension/newtab.html`** - Added storage management UI and script references
4. **`extension/styles.css`** - Added picture widget and storage management styles
5. **`extension/settings.js`** - Enhanced export/import for image data
6. **`extension/manifest.json`** - Already had required permissions

### üß™ Testing Instructions

To test the picture widget functionality:

#### 1. Load the Extension
- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable "Developer mode"
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` folder
- The extension should load without errors

#### 2. Test Basic Functionality
- Open a new tab (should show the Clean-Browsing interface)
- Open the browser console (F12) and verify these logs appear:
  - "StorageManager initialized successfully"
  - "Picture widget registered successfully"

#### 3. Test Picture Widget Creation
- Click the widgets button (‚¨õ)
- Look for "Picture" in the widget list
- Click "Picture" to create a new picture widget
- Upload an image (supports drag & drop)
- Configure image fit, opacity, and border radius
- Click "Add Picture Widget"

#### 4. Test Image Storage
- Upload images of various sizes (test both small <100KB and large >1MB)
- Large images should automatically compress
- Check browser console for compression messages

#### 5. Test Storage Management
- Click the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è)
- Go to "Configuration" tab
- Scroll down to "Storage Management" section
- Verify storage usage is displayed
- Test cleanup tools:
  - "Optimize Storage" - cleans orphaned images
  - "Clean Orphaned Images" - removes unused images
  - "Clear All Images" - removes all stored images

#### 6. Test Export/Import
- Create a picture widget with an image
- Use "Quick Export All" to export settings
- Delete the picture widget
- Use "Quick Import All" to restore (image should be restored)

#### 7. Test Widget Features
- Drag picture widgets around the grid
- Resize picture widgets
- Edit existing picture widgets (click settings icon)
- Delete picture widgets

### üîç Expected Behavior

#### Storage Management:
- Small images (<100KB): Stored as data URLs in localStorage
- Large images (>100KB): Stored in IndexedDB with compression
- Storage limit: 10MB total
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned images

#### Image Compression:
- Images >1MB automatically compressed to ~80% quality
- Max dimensions: 1920x1080 while maintaining aspect ratio
- JPEG conversion for better compression

#### Export/Import:
- Images embedded in export files as data URLs
- Large image collections included in imageDatabase section
- Cross-compatible between different browser instances

### üö® Troubleshooting

#### If picture widget doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all script files are loaded in correct order
3. Check `registerWidget('picture', ...)` is called

#### If images don't load:
1. Check IndexedDB is supported and accessible
2. Verify storage manager initialization
3. Check image file formats (supports: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

#### If export/import fails:
1. Check console for async/await errors
2. Verify storage manager methods are working
3. Check file size limits (max 5MB per image upload)
